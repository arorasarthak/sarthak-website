I am a Robotics Engineer currently working at [JetBrains, Amsterdam](https://jetbrains.com). My professional and academic background is in robotics software development and research. I love (working + contributing) on open source software projects and am always keen to (learn + apply) about new algorithms & techniques in robotics. 

Beside my passion for robotics, I spend my time in photography and making music.
